Included are project files to support my application for software engineering roles through the GSA's U.S. Digital Corps program.

tester.html: An HTML file to test the function findSearchTermInBooks()
book_search.js: A JavaScript source code file I wrote to implement findSearchTermInBooks() and its validation test.

findSearchTermInBooks(searchTerm, scannedTextObj) is a function that takes a string named searchTerm
and object named scannedTextObj as inputs, then return the book's ISBN, pages, and lines where the searchTerm 
is found or an empty string if no match is found.
To test this function, use any browser in developper mode.
